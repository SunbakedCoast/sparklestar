The app is made with BLoC architecture. I always do the separation of concerns in all of my apps so it doesn't look like spaghetti code when others view it. Maintainable and expandable code is must for me speciall working with a team. 

Level 1: 
This one is pretty easy for me this is very common in app development I had no problems with it.
Level 2: 
I managed to capture using the phone's camera with the help of image_picker package. Unfortunately, I didn't implement the local storage I haven't done that before in any of my apps so I was trying to learn it but time is limited and I won't be able to do that in time. 
Level 3: 
I've implemeneted the google maps and device's location there's just some problems with the API in which I have to pay for it to be able to reverse geocode or atleast see the result of the pinned location. It only shows the LatLng property 
Level 4: 
The app includes the authentication and has read and write operations using the firestore and the firebase storage.
